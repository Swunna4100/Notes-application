MyNotes 📝

A simple full-stack notes application built with Flask to understand how everyday apps like Apple Notes work under the hood.

Why I Built This

I use my phone’s notes app too much and wanted to understand how note creation, editing, deletion, authentication, and data handling actually work in practice. This project was built to strengthen my backend fundamentals and apply them in a real, usable product.

Features

User authentication (register, login, logout)
Create, edit, and delete notes
Flash messages for user feedback
Clean, responsive UI using Tailwind CSS
Secure session handling and access control

What I Learned

Structuring a Flask application cleanly
Handling application context and routing correctly
Implementing authentication and protected routes
Debugging common Flask issues like routing errors and context errors
Translating tutorials into understanding rather than copying code
